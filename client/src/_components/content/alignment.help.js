    </div>,
    cropImage: <div>
        <p>To crop an image to a smaller region:</p>
        <ol className={'list'}>
            <li>Select 'Crop' mode. This displays the crop tool below panels with
                loaded images.</li>
            <li>Click and drag on the image to outline the region of interest. The (X, Y) offset and (W, H) dimensions of the
                selected area are shown in the crop tool. Note that these values are scaled by the rendered image scale.
            </li>
            <li>Adjust the dimensions and position of the selected area from the crop panel or by
                dragging the selection box to a new location in the region. Using the 'Match' function you can also match
                the selected area to match the dimensions of the opposite panel image (if loaded). The selected area
                can be cleared using the <b>erase</b> control button, or by resetting, resizing or changing
                the view scale of the image.
            </li>
            <li>
                To apply the crop, click the green <Icon type={'crop'} /> <b>Crop</b> button in the lower crop panel.
            </li>
        </ol></div>,
    resizeImage: <div>
        <p>To resize an image:</p>
        <ol className={'list'}>
            <li>Click the 'resize' button above the image to open the Resizer tool</li>
            <li>In the Resizer tool, update the dimensions of the image (or canvas). You can match image width or height
                to the opposite panel image dimensions.
            </li>
            <li>Alternatively, you can scale the image by a factor. The aspect ratio of the image is maintained by default.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the 'Update' button to resize the image. Note that it is necessary to also save the image state to
                update the source image.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>,
    alignImages: <div>
        <p>To align and master two images in the Alignment Tool:</p>
        <ol className={'list'}>
            <li>Load images into the left and right panels</li>
            <li>Correct differences in image size by resizing an image such that the largest height/width
                matches that of the opposite image. Use the Resizer tool 'Match' function to match the height or width of
                the corresponding image.</li>
            <li>Click the <Icon type={'crosshairs'} /> <b>Align</b> button from the centre menu OR hit
                the <code>shift</code> key to switch to control point selection.
                The mouse cursor will appear as a crosshair. Click on a visual feature in the image to select each point.
                Four corresponding control points selected from each image are required for alignment.
            </li>
            <li>Identify four corresponding features in the image. Use these guidelines for selection: (1) The control
                points should be pixels that you can identify in both images that havenâ€™t varied over time. (2) The
                control points need to be spread in a box shape around the image; (3) Select points that reduce
                the collinearity coefficient as close to zero as possible. (4) To select more precise control points,
                use pan and zoom into the region of interest, or use the image magnifier by holding down the <code>ctrl</code> key .
            </li>
            <li>Selected control points will appear on the image as cross-shaped markers numbered in the order they were created.
                The coordinates of control points are shown in the Align tool below the canvas. Click
                "Overlay" to view both sets of control points on the same image.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the coordinates or delete control point by clicking the marker icon in the Control
                Points tool.</li>
            <li>Once four control point pairs have been selected, from the panel of the 'target' image to be transformed,
                click the green "Align" button on the Align tool. The image will be transformed
                using perspective transformation
                (See <a target={'_blank'} rel={"noreferrer"} href={'https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/da/d54/group__imgproc__transform.html'}>OpenCV documentation</a>).
            </li>
            <li>To validate the alignment, click the <Icon type={'images'} /> <b>Compare</b> button in the centre menu to
                load the images into the <b>Compare Tool</b>. The images will appear superimposed. Use the opacity slider to compare
                alignment of the selected features. If the two images are of different shapes, you can crop both images to the
                same size in the Compare Tool (follow the same instructions as for panel cropping). Once a crop has been applied,
                click "Save" to replace the panel images with the cropped versions.

        <h4>Alignment Tool: Getting Started</h4>
        <p>
            The Alignment Tool is a basic image viewer, editor and alignment tool that allows you to work directly
            with the images from the Mountain Legacy collection, or with other images loaded from your computer.
        </p>

        <ol className={'list'}>
            <li><b>Basic Features:</b> Panning, zooming, cropping and resizing. Image files can also be
                downloaded to your local machine, or loaded/uploaded to the MLP Library.</li>
            <li><b>Image Comparison:</b> Images can be viewed side-by-side and as transparent overlays.</li>
            <li><b>Image Alignment:</b> Images of the same scene can be aligned using user-selected control points.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Image Panels</h5>
        <p>Alignment Tool has left and right image panels each with a canvas where the image is displayed, and a
            control menu with different image operations. Panels have multiple canvases
            or layers that allow you to view and interact with images:
        </p>
        <ol className={'list'}>
            <li>Rendered or 'View' Layers, which display the scaled and visible portion of the image within
                the bounds of the canvas</li>
            <li>Markup or 'Overlay' Layers, where graphics such as control points and crop boxes appear
                superimposed on the image. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other hidden layers store multiple resolutions of the image. The original 'source' image data
            is stored in state in case a reset is required.
        </p>
        <p>The panel control menu above the canvas view applies operations to load, save, view or
            transform the panel image. See <b>Panel Controls</b> for details. The Info Panel above the canvas
            provides information about the loaded image. See <b>Panel Info</b> for details.</p>

        <h5>Loading Images</h5>
        <p>
            Use one of the following methods to load JPEG, PNG, or TIFF images into a panel:
        </p>

        <h4>Image Registration</h4>
        <p>
            Image registration is the process of aligning two images of the same scene so that corresponding
            features or points in the images are in spatial correspondence. In other words, it involves finding
            a transformation that maps the pixels of one image onto the pixels of another image, such that the
            two images are geometrically aligned.
            </p>
        <p>
            The goal of image registration is to compensate for any differences in rotation, translation,
            scale, or distortion between the images, so that they can be compared, fused, or used together for
            further analysis. By aligning the images, valuable information can be extracted, such as identifying
            changes over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Images can be aligned and mastered in the Alignment Tool using the 'Control Point' tool to select coordinates for
            four matching features found in both images. These four paired features are marked in the images as
            'control points' (coordinates on the image) that are used to estimate the transformation parameters
            used to align the images.
