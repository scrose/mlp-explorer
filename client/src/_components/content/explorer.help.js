        <h4>Explorer: Getting Started</h4>
        <p>
            The Mountain Legacy Project has the world's most extensive compilation of meticulously captured,
            high-resolution historic mountain photographs, totaling over 120,000 images.
            Additionally, the project possesses a rapidly expanding assortment of repeat images,
            consisting of over 8,000 pairs of photographs.</p>
        <p>To explore this remarkable collection, the
            Project offers a user-friendly web-based tool known as the "Explorer."
            This online platform allows visitors to navigate, search, and filter the vast array of
            collection items based on surveyor metadata or the geographical location of survey Stations.
        </p>

        <h5>What is Repeat Photography?</h5>
        <p>
            Itâ€™s as simple as it sounds. You start with one photo, which was taken at a specific location in a
            specific direction (azimuth), at a specific time. You repeat this photo when you find that same location,
            point the camera in the same direction, and press the shutter release of your camera. The big difference
            between the two photos is temporal. Repeat photographs leverage the systematic nature of the original work,
            allowing researchers to re-photograph the same continuous coverage of the landscape captured by the historic images.
            Taken together, the historic photo and the modern repeat form an image pair. Through careful
            interpretation and analysis, MLP image pairs can be used to explore the dynamics and interplay of
            ecological, climate, and human-induced changes in the landscape. Digital assets include multiple
            versions of historical digitized images (e.g., unprocessed scan; cropped master), repeat images
            (RAW, TIFF and various field-useable images), location images, EXIF camera data, survey and MLP
            field notes and maps.

        <h5>About this Guide</h5>
        <p>
            This guide covers usage of features available in both the Explorer, and the Alignment Tool as well as documentation for the MLE Editor management tool. Click on the
            tabs at the top to switch between tools, and the tabs to the left for tool topics.

        <h4>Exploring the View</h4>

        <h5>Using the Viewer</h5>

        <p>Use the right-side viewer panel to explore the MLP collection images and metadata in detail.
            Search and filter results are also loaded in the viewer.</p>
        <p>The viewer is where <Button icon={'help'} label={'Capture Images'} onClick={() => {gotoPage(0, 2)}} />
            and <Button icon={'help'} label={'Metadata'} onClick={() => {gotoPage(0, 1)}} /> are
            loaded for an indepth look at things. For example, navigate to
            surveyor <a href={"/surveyors/show/5"} target={'_blank'} rel={"noreferrer"}>Morrison Parsons Bridgland</a> to see
            an extensive list of surveys undertaken in the last century. Each survey in the list can be expanded to
            show metadata for that item, as well as any attached dependent items -- in this case, survey seasons.
            You can also click on the item label to go to open the page for that item.</p>

        <h5>Viewer Tabs</h5>
        <p>At the top of the page you will find a number of tabs for any given data item in the model.</p>

        <h4>How Explorer is Organized</h4>

        <h5>MLP Data Model</h5>

        <p>A data model for metadata provides a conceptual representation of the structure, relationships,
            and attributes of metadata within a given context or domain. It defines how
            metadata is organized, stored, and managed.</p>

        <p>
            To organize the MLP collection with its thousands of historic and repeat images, as well as its extensive
            database of metadata, a data model has been developed that organizes images by surveyors, surveys,
            survey seasons, stations, visits, and locations. As well, a alternative schema grouped around 'Projects' is
            provided for captures taken by MLP field researchers that do not neatly fit into the surveyor model. </p>
        <p>Each data item in this model is referred to as a <b>node</b> where each node represents a data object of
            core metadata that has both attributes and relationships with other nodes. The relationships are also nested,
            and nodes in the data model frequently contain other nodes. Surveyors have multiple Surveys, Surveys have multiple
            Survey Seasons, Survey Seasons Station each contain an Historic Visit and multiple Modern Visits, and so on.
            This nested hierarchical model is illustrated in <b>Figure 1</b>. A full list of nodes is shown below.
        </p>

                <td>
                    <p>The concept of a station has its roots in the historic surveys. A surveyor would identify a high
                        point in the
                        landscape where photographs were required to be taken. Upon arrival to that location, several
                        photographs
                        would be taken, usually in as many directions as possible. In many cases, the camera
                        would have to be
                        moved around to find the best vantage point for a particular cardinal direction. Thus,
                        there were many 'sub locations' within the general location of the Station. A Station is
                        therefore loosely defined by a geographic location where the distance between
                        sub locations is within a reasonable walking distance. This loose distinction
                        between Station and location has occasionally differed between different surveyors
                        (MLP always groups the images into Stations defined by the Surveyor, if known).</p>

        <h4>What is a Capture?</h4>

        <h5>Historic and Modern Captures</h5>
        <p>
            The core artifact of the MLP collection is the capture, which corresponds to a landscape view
            that is unique in location, azimuth, date, and time. For example, given a tripod setup, with the
            camera pointed in a specific direction, suppose photos are taken at f/16, 1/50 sec, and then another
            with a different exposure setting. Though we might consider these photos as sharing the same view, they form
            different captures because they were taken at different times.
        </p>
        <p>The collection has two types of captures:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Historic Capture</b> A Historic Capture may be associated with information related to
                where its glass plate negative is located.
            </li>
            <li><b>Modern (Repeat) Capture</b> The exposure settings of a capture are generally known.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Capture Images</h5>
        <p>
            A capture is typically not represented by a single image file, but can include many versions
            of the same image, as shown in <b>Figure 2</b> below. These versions, called <b>capture images</b>,
            are each designated an image state to distinguish different versions (see <b>Image States</b> table below)</p>
        <p>
            For example, a photo taken for a given date, time, and location is a capture. If you delete the
            image file associated with that capture, the capture still exists. This case is rare. Whatâ€™s more
            common is that an image file associated with a capture is modified several times in the MLP workflow.
            Specifically, a capture is initially represented by a raw file (when the Hasselblad is used create
            the capture, this would be a 3FR file). The raw file would be converted into a tiff file.
            The tiff file would then be registered (aligned/overlaid) with the historic image.
        </p>
        <p>
            To recap, a capture can have zero to many capture images. Each capture image has both an image file
            and an image state, where the state distinguishes the versions of the image. All the capture images
            for a specific capture are derived (indirectly or directly) from the same image file (usually a raw file).

        <p>
            Use the navigator (located on the left-side panel) to search, filter and open up the vast
            MLP photographic library and database. Click on the <Icon type={'expand'} /> icon to open or close the submenus.
            Selecting or searching clickable items in the navigator loads
            metadata in the <b>Viewer</b> pane on the right.
