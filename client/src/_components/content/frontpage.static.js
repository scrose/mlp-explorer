        The Mountain Legacy Project (MLP) explores changes in Canada’s mountain
        landscapes through the world’s largest collection of systematic
        high-resolution historic mountain photographs.

    <p>
        Explorer is a map-based tool for browsing the MLP collection and viewing historic
        and their repeat (modern) survey images. Use the navigator panel on the left to explore the collection.</p>
