krb5 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have krb5 first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/krb5/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/krb5/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find krb5 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/krb5/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/krb5/include"

For pkg-config to find krb5 you may need to set:

  brew postgresql-upgrade-database

To have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:
  brew services start postgresql
