        <h4>Getting Started</h4>
        <p>
            Welcome to the The Mountain Legacy Explorer user guide. This guide is intended to
            provide background information along with step-by-step instructions on how to
            navigate the MLP collection. The guide covers usage of features available in both the Explorer
            and Image analysis Toolkit, as well as detailed info on using the Editor management tool.

        <h5>What is Repeat Photography?</h5>
        <p>
            Itâ€™s as simple as it sounds. You start with one photo, which was taken at a specific location in a
            specific direction (azimuth), at a specific time. You repeat this photo when you find that same location,
            point the camera in the same direction, and press the shutter release of your camera. The big difference
            between the two photos is temporal. Repeat photographs leverage the systematic nature of the original work,
            allowing researchers to re-photograph the same continuous coverage of the landscape captured by the historic images.
            Taken together, the historic photo and the modern repeat form an image pair. Through careful
            interpretation and analysis, MLP image pairs can be used to explore the dynamics and interplay of
            ecological, climate, and human-induced changes in the landscape. Digital assets include multiple
            versions of historical digitized images (e.g., unprocessed scan; cropped master), repeat images
            (RAW, TIFF and various field-useable images), location images, EXIF camera data, survey and MLP
            field notes and maps.

        <h5>Mountain Legacy Explorer (MLE)</h5>
        <p>The Explorer is a web-based tool for exploring Mountain Legacy Project's
            vast collection of historic survey photos, modern repeat images and metadata.
            Visitors can navigate, search and filter collection items by surveyor metadata or
            by geographical location of survey stations.</p>

        <h4>MLP Data Model</h4>

        <h5>Model Hierarchy</h5>

        <p>
            The MLP Library consists of thousands of captures and historic captures, and tens of thousands of associated
            images. To organize this data set, an hierarchical schema has been developed to organize images by
            surveyors, surveys, survey seasons, stations, visits, and locations.
            An example of this hierarchy can be seen in <b>Figure 1</b> below. A comparatively small number of
            of captures taken by MLP do not neatly fit into the surveyor model, and are instead grouped
            according to projects.
        </p>

        <p>Each element in the hierarchy is defined as a <b>node</b>, and represents a data object of core metadata
            that has both attributes and hierarchical relationships with other nodes. Nodes in the collection data model
            can serve as containers for other nodes, or as terminal nodes. For example, a Station node is a
            container for Visit nodes.</p>

                <td>
                    <p>The concept of a station has its roots in the historic surveys. A surveyor would identify a high
                        point in the
                        landscape where photographs were required to be taken. Upon arrival to that location, several
                        photographs
                        would be taken, usually in as many directions as possible. In many circumstances, the camera
                        would have to be
                        moved around in order gain the best vantage point for a particular cardinal direction. Thus,
                        there were many sub
                        locations within the general location of the station. Therefore, a station can be loosely
                        defined as a broad
                        geographic location where the distance between sub locations is within a reasonable walking
                        distance. This
                        is intentionally loosely defined, since the distinction between station and location has
                        occasionally
                        differed between different surveyors (MLP always groups the images into stations defined by the
                        surveyor, if
                        known).</p>

                        the historic visit. A visit is uniquely identified by the date at which it occurred. Multiple
                        visits may occur
                        for each station. The visit object is a container for all information related to that specific

        <h4>Historic and Modern Captures</h4>

        <h5>What is a capture?</h5>
        <p>
            The core artifact of the MLP collection is the capture, which corresponds to a landscape view
            that is unique in location, azimuth, date, and time. For example, given a tripod setup, with the
            camera pointed in a specific direction, suppose photos are taken at f/16, 1/50 sec, and then another
            with a different exposure setting. Though we might consider these photos as sharing the same view, they form
            different captures because they were taken at different times.
        </p>
        <p>The collection has two types of captures:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Historic Capture</b> A historic capture may be associated with information related to
                where its glass plate negative is located.
            </li>
            <li><b>Modern (Repeat) Capture</b> The exposure settings of a capture are generally known.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Capture Images</h5>
        <p>
            A capture is typically not represented by a single image file, but can include many versions
            of the same image, as shown in <b>Figure 2</b> below. These versions, called <b>capture images</b>,
            are each designated an image state to distinguish different versions (see <b>Image States</b> table below)</p>
        <p>
            For example, a photo taken for a given date, time, and location is a capture. If you delete the
            image file associated with that capture, the capture still exists. This case is rare. Whatâ€™s more
            common is that an image file associated with a capture is modified several times in the MLP workflow.
            Specifically, a capture is initially represented by a raw file (when the Hasselblad is used create
            the capture, this would be a 3FR file). The raw file would be converted into a tiff file.
            The tiff file would then be registered (aligned/overlaid) with the historic image.
        </p>
        <p>
            To recap, a capture can have zero to many capture images. Each capture image has both an image file
            and an image state, where the state distinguishes the versions of the image. All the capture images
            for a specific capture are derived (indirectly or directly) from the same image file (usually a raw file).

               instances of that same photo, differentiated by image states,image modifications, and file types.`} />

        <h4>Using the Navigator</h4>
        <p>
            Use the navigator (located on the left-side panel) to search, filter and open up the vast MLP photographic library and
            database. Click on the <Icon type={'expand'} /> icon to open or close the submenus.
            Selecting or searching clickable items in the navigator loads
            metadata in the <b>Viewer</b> pane on the right.
        </p>

        <h5>Navigator Features</h5>
        <p>The navigators offers four ways to explore the collection:</p>

                    <p>Click on the marker to view the list of stations in the

                    <p>Pan by dragging the map; zoom by double clicking the map area, or use the zoom controls at top

        <h5>Cookie Crumb Trail</h5>

        <p>The cookie crumb trail is a navigational aid that helps track the location of the page loaded relative to
        the navigator model.</p>

        <h5>View Menu</h5>

        <p>The view menu is just below the cookie crumb trail, and provides some additional
            options such as metadata <b>Export</b> and <b>Help</b> pages.</p>

        <h5>Item Status</h5>
        <p>Icons used in the navigator tree are colour-coded to indicate the status of the metadata or images
        associated with that node.</p>
