        <div>To load an image from a local directory to the Alignment Tool:</div>
        <ol className={'list'}>
            <li>Click the <Icon type={'load'} /> open file button in the panel controls, or
                click 'Click to load' button on the centre of the panel.
            </li>
            <li>Select "Open Local Image File" or drag and drop a file into the import box and click
                "Open Image".
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>,
    clusterStationMarkers: <div>
        <p>To upload an image to the MLP Library from the Alignment Tool:</p>
        <ol className={'list'}>
            <li>Locate the capture image in the navigator tree</li>
            <li>Click the <Icon type={'iat'}/> icon to open the Alignment Loader tool</li>
            <li>Select which Alignment panel you want to load the image</li>
            <li>Select the image format for the uploaded image</li>
            <li>Select the image version you want to upload</li>
            <li>Click the green 'Upload Image to MLP Library' button</li>
        </ol>
    </div>,
    cropImage: <div>
        <p>To crop an image to a smaller region:</p>
        <ol className={'list'}>
            <li>Select 'Crop' mode. This displays the crop tool below panels with
                loaded images.</li>
            <li>Click and drag on the image to outline the region of interest. The (X, Y) offset and (W, H) dimensions of the
                selected area are shown in the crop tool. Note that these values are scaled by the rendered image scale.
            </li>
            <li>Adjust the dimensions and position of the selected area from the crop panel or by
                dragging the selection box to a new location in the region. Using the 'Match' function you can also match
                the selected area to match the dimensions of the opposite panel image (if loaded). The selected area
                can be cleared using the <b>erase</b> control button, or by resetting, resizing or changing
                the view scale of the image.
            </li>
            <li>
                To apply the crop, click the green <Icon type={'crop'} /> <b>Crop</b> button in the lower crop panel.
            </li>
        </ol></div>,
    resizeImage: <div>
        <p>To resize an image:</p>
        <ol className={'list'}>
            <li>Click the 'resize' button above the image to open the Resizer tool</li>
            <li>In the Resizer tool, update the dimensions of the image (or canvas). You can match image width or height
                to the opposite panel image dimensions.
            </li>
            <li>Alternatively, you can scale the image by a factor. The aspect ratio of the image is maintained by default.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the 'Update' button to resize the image. Note that it is necessary to also save the image state to
                update the source image.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>,
    alignImages: <div>
        <p>To align and master two images in the Alignment Tool:</p>
        <ol className={'list'}>
            <li>Load images into the left and right panels</li>
            <li>Correct differences in image size by resizing an image such that the largest height/width
                matches that of the opposite image. Use the Resizer tool 'Match' function to match the height or width of
                the corresponding image.</li>
            <li>Click the <Icon type={'crosshairs'} /> <b>Align</b> button from the centre menu OR hit
                the <code>shift</code> key to switch to control point selection.
                The mouse cursor will appear as a crosshair. Click on a visual feature in the image to select each point.
                Four corresponding control points selected from each image are required for alignment.
            </li>
            <li>Identify four corresponding features in the image. Use these guidelines for selection: (1) The control
                points should be pixels that you can identify in both images that havenâ€™t varied over time. (2) The
                control points need to be spread in a box shape around the image; (3) Select points that reduce
                the collinearity coefficient as close to zero as possible. (4) To select more precise control points,
                use pan and zoom into the region of interest, or use the image magnifier by holding down the <code>ctrl</code> key .
            </li>
            <li>Selected control points will appear on the image as cross-shaped markers numbered in the order they were created.
                The coordinates of control points are shown in the Align tool below the canvas. Click
                "Overlay" to view both sets of control points on the same image.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the coordinates or delete control point by clicking the marker icon in the Control
                Points tool.</li>
            <li>Once four control point pairs have been selected, from the panel of the 'target' image to be transformed,
                click the green "Align" button on the Align tool. The image will be transformed
                using perspective transformation
                (See <a target={'_blank'} rel={"noreferrer"} href={'https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/da/d54/group__imgproc__transform.html'}>OpenCV documentation</a>).
            </li>
            <li>To validate the alignment, click the <Icon type={'images'} /> <b>Compare</b> button in the centre menu to
                load the images into the <b>Compare Tool</b>. The images will appear superimposed. Use the opacity slider to compare
                alignment of the selected features. If the two images are of different shapes, you can crop both images to the
                same size in the Compare Tool (follow the same instructions as for panel cropping). Once a crop has been applied,
                click "Save" to replace the panel images with the cropped versions.
